# Advanced Moderation System For Discord Bots
This is **<\/EmeraldDev06\>**'s open-source and advanced moderation Discord bot, which includes an NSFW detector that you can use for your own and your friends' Discord servers!
It features moderation actions, including working multi-ban commands.

Improvements need to be made, as this is the first version of the open-source code:
- [ ] A fully functional logging system for Automod
- [ ] The ability to apply punishments other than bans for members with inappropriate profile pictures
- [ ] A user-friendly guide on how to use the bot

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Slurs and offensive words are added by default to prevent users from having to research what constitutes a slur or offensive term.
> The NSFW detection may sometimes flag innocent content. I learned this the hard way as a developer. (If it works, it works!)
> The NSFW detector scans images only and cannot be turned off for a reason—some users attempt to bypass Discord's anti-NSFW system by posting adult URLs.
> Also, to run the bot, put the token in .env file `TOKEN="PutYourDiscordBotTokenHere"`

> [!NOTE]
> You can fork this project and improve upon it.
> The code supports multiple servers, so feel free to use it across different servers!

> [!TIP]
> I highly recommend using [Silly Development](https://sillydev.co.uk/)'s VPS service if you're looking for a way to host your bot 24/7. (ToS is enforced there—just a heads-up!)
