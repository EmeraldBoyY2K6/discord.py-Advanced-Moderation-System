# Advanced Moderation System
This is **<\/EmeraldDev06\>**'s open source & advanced moderation system that includes NSFW detector\n
This includes moderation actions with working multi-ban commands!\n
Improvements must be made, since it's first version of the open source code
- [ ] Support for Tempban
- [ ] User-friendly guide on how to use it

> [!NOTE]
> You can fork this & improvise it.
> This code has support for multiple servers (So, feel free to use it on multiple servers!)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The NSFW detection can sometimes flags innocent things. I learned the hard way as an developer. (If it works then it works!)

> [!TIP]
> I highly recommend using [Silly Development](https://sillydev.co.uk/)'s VPS Service if you are searching ways to host your bot 24/7. (ToS is enforced in there, gotta tell you that!)
