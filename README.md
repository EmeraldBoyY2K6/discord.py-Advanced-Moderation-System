# Advanced Moderation System For Discord Bots
This is **<\/EmeraldDev06\>**'s open source & advanced moderation system that includes NSFW detector that you can use for your & your friend's discord servers!
This includes moderation actions with working multi-ban commands!
Improvements must be made, since it's first version of the open source code
- [ ] Working Logging System for the Automod
- [ ] Ability to setup other punishment for members with inappropriate profile picture than just ban
- [ ] User-friendly guide on how to use it

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The NSFW detection can sometimes flags innocent things. I learned the hard way as an developer. (If it works then it works!)
> The NSFW detector detects the images only & can't be turned off for reason (Weirdos bypassing Discord's Anti NSFW system by posting adult URL's)
> Also, create an .env file & put the token in there `TOKEN="PutYourDiscordBotTokenHere"`

> [!NOTE]
> You can fork this & improvise it.
> This code has support for multiple servers (So, feel free to use it on multiple servers!)

> [!TIP]
> I highly recommend using [Silly Development](https://sillydev.co.uk/)'s VPS Service if you are searching ways to host your bot 24/7. (ToS is enforced in there, gotta tell you that!)
