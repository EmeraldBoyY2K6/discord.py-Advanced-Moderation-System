# discord.py-Moderation-System-NSFW-Detection-
My recipe of working Auto-Moderation System


> [!NOTE]
> You can fork this, improvise it.
> This code has support for multiple servers (So, feel free to use it on multiple servers!)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The NSFW detection can sometimes flags innocent things. I learned the hard way as the dev.

> [!TIP]
> I highly recommend using [Silly Development](https://sillydev.co.uk/)'s VPS Service if you are searching ways to host your bot 24/7. (ToS is enforced in there, gotta tell you that!)
